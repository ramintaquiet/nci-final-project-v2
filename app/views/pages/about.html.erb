            We welcome you to the freshest concept for pet mating!
            You may stop asking your neighbours or friends if they own, 
            or have seen a cat/dog like yours that wants to mate. Now you can stop running 
            like a maniac to strangers when you see that they are accompanied by a companion 
            animal that’s the same dog breed as yours, and of course you can stop buying 7
            teddy bears, pillows etc. to temporarily satisfy your dog’s natural need for breeding until you find a real mate for your cat, dog or other beloved pet.

            Tinder for pets provides you with an easy, fun, and serious way to find, not just a mate, but the perfect mate for 
            your loving companion animal. Our main goal is to make you proud by making your dog a dad or a mum and, why not, to add 
            an offspring to your extended family. Create your pet’s profile, and Tinder for pets will offer you a wide choice of available
             mates that look and weigh similar to your dog. Select your favorite or favorites and contact them to set a date. Your dog and its mate will do the rest!
              We hope that you and your beloved pet will enjoy the Tinder for pets.
